# Testing Revisited

## Testing Lifecycle
1. Requirements Analysis
    - Gather and analyze the requirements
    - Reviewing documents, structure, code, etc.
2. Test planning
    - What to test, how to test, when to test
    - Cost/time estimation
    - Team structuring
    - Test plan documentation preparation
3. Test design
    - Prepare test scenarios
    - Prepare test cases
    - Review test cases
4. Test setup/execution
    - Populate test data (have some data prepared for testing purposes in the database)
        - In our case, we can configure a data.sql file with INSERT queries (for a Spring Boot application)
    - Setup test environment (hardware, software)
    - Execute test cases
5. Test defect reporting/tracking
    - Defect lifecycle
6. Test closure phase
