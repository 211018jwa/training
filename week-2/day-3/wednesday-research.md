# Wednesday Independent Research

Today, practice your independent research skills. As a developer, you will constantly need to learn new technologies, often independently with very little guidance. 

Training is intended to get you introduced to different concepts and topics, and then it is up to you to take it to the next level once you are placed with a client on an actual project.

The best time to start this habit is **NOW**. Therefore, while 1-on-1s are ongoing, please do independent research, going in this general order:

1. Wrapper classes
    - Behave as blueprints for objects that can "wrap" (encapsulate) primitive values inside of them
    - Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean
    - Look into the idea of Autoboxing AND unboxing
    - Why do we need wrapper classes?
2. Collections API
    - List interface
        - ArrayList class
        - LinkedList class
    - Map interface
        - HashMap class
    - Set interface
        - HashSet class
    - Queue interface
    - Most utilized will be lists. Especially try to understand lists deeply and the methods that List defines
    - Look at the Java docs!
3. Generics
    - You will find that Collections can store particular types of objects
    - You will see the `<>` syntax
    - This is the syntax for the concept of **generics**
