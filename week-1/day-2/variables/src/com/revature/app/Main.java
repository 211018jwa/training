	 * Variables
	 * 
	 * What types of variables do we have in Java?
	 * 	1. primitive variables: directly store values "within them" in memory
	 *  2. reference variables: refer to other locations in memory. In particular, reference variables "point" to the location of objects in memory
	 *  
	 *  Within memory (RAM), we have two separate areas of memory: the stack and the heap
	 *  
	 * What types of primitive variables do we have?
	 * 
	 * 3 Overarching primitive types:
	 * 	1. boolean
	 * 	2. integral types (byte, short, char, int, long)
	 * 		char is a special one that is intended to store characters
	 * 	3. floating-point types (float and double)
	 *  
	 *  1. boolean: technically 1 bit, JVM dependent (sometimes the JVM allocates, for example 8 bits, but in reality you just need 1 bit)
	 *  2. byte: 8 bits (bits are the smallest units of data that can be either 0 or 1)
	 *  	-128 to 127
	 *  	Whole numbers only (integral types)
	 *  3. short: 16 bits
	 *  	-32768 to 32767
	 *  	Whole numbers only (integral types)
	 *  4. char: 16 bits
	 *  	0 to 65535
	 *  	Whole numbers only (integral types)
	 *  	however, typically not used to store numbers
	 *  	this variable type is instead used to store a single character such as 'a', 'A', '@', '$', 'Z', '1'
	 *  5. int: 32 bits
	 *  	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
	 *  	Whole numbers only (integral types)
	 *  6. long: 64 bits
	 * 		-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
	 * 		Whole numbers only (integral types)
	 * 	7. float: 32 bits
	 *  	+- 1.2 * 10^-38 to 3.4 * 10^38
	 *  	Represent numbers with decimals (floating point type)
	 * 	8. double: 64 bits
	 *  	+- 2.3 * 10^-308 to 1.7 * 10^308
	 *  	Represent numbers with decimals (floating point type)
